# Installing on command line

Just use the go get command (you'll need a Go and C compiler installed first):

```
go get github.com/fyne-io/terminal/cmd/fyneterm
```

# Installing as an app

To get the app installed alongside your other applications (with metadata, icons etc),
use the `fyne` tool, as illustrated below:

```
$ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne
$ fyne get github.com/fyne-io/terminal/cmd/fyneterm
```

# TODO

There are lots of great things that could be added to this app.
Already planned is:

* Tabs
* Scroll-back
* Background and font/size customisation
* Split panels
* Windows support
* Copy and Paste

# Library

You can also use this project as a library to create your own
terminal based applications, using the import path "github.com/fyne-io/terminal".

There are two modes, using the default shell (macOS and Linux) or connecting
to a remote shell.

## Local Shell

To load a terminal widget and launch the current shell (works on macOS and Linux)
use the `RunLocalShell` method after creating a `Terminal`, as follows:

```go
	// win is a fyne.Window created to hold the content
	t := terminal.New()
	w.SetContent(t)

	go func() {
		_ = t.RunLocalShell()
		a.Quit()
	}()
	w.ShowAndRun()
```

## Remote connection

For example to open a terminal to an SSH connection that you have created:

```go
	// session is an *ssh.Session from golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
	// win is a fyne.Window created to hold the content
	in, _ := session.StdinPipe()
	out, _ := session.StdoutPipe()

	go session.Run("$SHELL || bash")

	t := terminal.New()
	w.SetContent(t)

	go func() {
		_ = t.RunWithConnection(in, out)
		a.Quit()
	}()
	w.ShowAndRun()
```
